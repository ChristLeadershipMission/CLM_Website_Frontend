          In adherence to the directives outlined in the New Testament, the
          financial sustenance of the gospel&apos;s mission within the Church is
          facilitated through the faithful contributions of Tithes, Offerings,
          First Fruits, and Seedfaith Offerings. We operate on the principle of
          divine provision, abstaining from pledges and debt, trusting entirely
          in God&apos;s abundant provision, as promised through Christ Jesus.
          Thus, we extend a heartfelt invitation, urging all to participate in
          this act of faith by bringing forth their offerings and tithes into
          the sanctuary of God, dedicated to the advancement of His Kingdom.

          God has the power to shower you with abundant grace, ensuring that
          you always have more than enough for every need, enabling you to excel
          in every good deed. Just as He provides seeds to the sower and
          sustenance to the eater, He will multiply the seeds you sow and
          enhance the results of your righteous actions. (2 Corinthians 9:8, 10){" "}
